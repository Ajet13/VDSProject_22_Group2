<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
In the course of this Lab assignment students are going to implement a minimal BDD package in C++. This package implements the fundamental manipulation methods for ROBDDs as they were introduced in the lecture Verification of Digital Systems by Prof. Kunz. The package will be implemented using the Test Driven Development (TDD) paradigm presented by Dr. Wedler.

The project is split into three parts:
<p align="right">(<a href="#top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### Part1:
Implementation of the basic functionality of the BDD package using the TDD methodology. This is the biggest part of the project.

Main tasks in this part:
* Set up and maintain a Git repository
* Use CMake as a build system of the project
* Verify the code using GTest
* Set up a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline with GitHub Actions **(Mandatory)**
* Use Doxygen (or a similar tool) to generate documentation for the API. _(Optional)_

There are many great README templates available on GitHub; however, I didn't find one that really suited my needs so I created this enhanced one. I want to create a README template so amazing that it'll be the last one you ever need -- I think this is it.

Here's why:
* Your time should be focused on creating something amazing. A project that solves a problem and helps others
* You shouldn't be doing the same tasks over and over like creating a README from scratch
* You should implement DRY principles to the rest of your life :smile:

Of course, no one template will serve all projects since your needs may be different. So I'll be adding more in the near future. You may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue. Thanks to all the people have contributed to expanding this template!

Use the `BLANK_README.md` to get started.
